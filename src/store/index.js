/* 
configureStore creates a store basically
the important part is when we don't use toolkit, we have 1 State and 1 createStore that 
takes 1 reducer function. However, with toolkit we have different state "slices" like
counterSlice, we put all these slices into reducer with syntax like
reducer: {counter: counterSlice.reducer} and it creates us 1 reducer function for store
with merged slices
